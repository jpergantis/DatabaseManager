# DatabaseManager
Simple database manager using Java and SQLite.

Currently supports:
 - Viewing tables within database (.db) files
 - Sorting results numerically and alphabetically
 - Filtering results within a table by a given value (currently inputs are not checked/sanitized and just passed directly in - use caution)
